# BROKEN ON PURPOSE -- do not fix: this is a fixture for
# tests/test_cookbook_snowpark.py::test_the_carry_over_example_catches_a_dropped_reset (fix round
# 1, finding C2). The mistake: the cancellation reset is gone -- the Alteryx script zeroes the
# carried deferred balance before a cancelled period's own cap is applied; this variant just
# carries the balance on, which is what anyone reading the loop for its arithmetic rather than
# its bookkeeping would leave out. It is example.py's own transform() with exactly those two
# lines deleted (the NULL CANCELLED guard above them is deliberately left in place, so the diff
# against example.py is the reset and nothing else). Mirrors
# samples/wf_0006/broken/01_cancellation_reset_ignored.py's own mutation of the same
# pattern.
