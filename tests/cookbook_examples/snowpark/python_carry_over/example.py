# workflow). Sequential per customer (the deferred balance feeds the next period's cap check and
# resets on cancellation), so the rows are processed in pandas exactly as the Alteryx script does
# -- this is the body a build.py's `main()` wraps, returning the DataFrame instead of writing it,
# since a real `main()` does the write itself.
