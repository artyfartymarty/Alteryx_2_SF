-- tool 2: Record ID -- numbers rows from 100 in incoming order (SEQ, an upstream ordinal) and
-- puts the field first. Snowflake tables carry no implicit row order, so a real build file needs
-- this same explicit ordering column from whatever established determinism upstream (a Sort, or
-- the source query's own ORDER BY) -- see Parity risk 1.
