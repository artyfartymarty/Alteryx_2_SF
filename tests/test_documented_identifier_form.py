"""No tracked file teaches an expression inside `IDENTIFIER(…)` (Task C4V).

Since the objective-first change the form is retired: a build file reads `{{src}}.<LOGICAL>` and writes
`{{tgt}}.<LOGICAL>`, and `compile_check.py` refuses a procedure, a `LET` or an `IDENTIFIER(` outright
(`statement:kind`). This scan stays so that no tracked text teaches the old expression form again, and it
tolerates the files that taught it being deleted: an entry of the two allow-lists below that is no longer
tracked is simply not counted (the segment-era tests that proved the refusal are removed with the
procedures they tested).

Snowflake's documentation (docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/identifier-literal) gives the
grammar `IDENTIFIER( { string_literal | session_variable | bind_variable |
snowflake_scripting_variable } )` -- a single value, not an expression. Every SQL procedure this
pipeline writes therefore builds each mapped table's name first,
`LET <LOGICAL>_SRC VARCHAR := SRC_DB || '.' || SRC_SCHEMA || '.<LOGICAL>';`, and references it
as `IDENTIFIER(:<LOGICAL>_SRC)` (contract C4). Inside the LET the procedure's arguments are named
without a colon (Snowflake's documented expression syntax -- the colon binds a variable inside a SQL
statement, which is where `IDENTIFIER(:<LOGICAL>_SRC)` sits; fix round 1). That is the DOCUMENTED
form; nothing here has run on Snowflake, and the first real-account run (the hand-off's verification
ladder) confirms it.

`compile_check.py` refuses the expression form in a procedure (`c4:identifier_expression`) and a colon
inside a LET (`c4:let_form`), and the policy's SQL judge denies both; this scan keeps every OTHER
tracked text -- the cookbook, the agent instructions, the docs, the test fixtures, the orchestrator's
fakes -- from teaching either again.
