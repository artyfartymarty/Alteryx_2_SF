"""The rules a Snowpark module must satisfy (spec §4.2; objective-first design §4.5), as one AST walk.

The module is a workflow's one `build.py`: `def main(session, src: str, tgt: str) -> str`, sources read as
`session.table(f"{src}.<LOGICAL>")`, targets written as `.write.mode("overwrite" | "append" | ...)
.save_as_table(f"{tgt}.<LOGICAL>")` (or the `MERGE` form), every logical one `objective.json` declares.
`check_build_py(source, objective)` applies the rules, each error one line `rule:<name>: line N: <expectation>`.
Step markers (`# step s1`) are `compile_check.py`'s, not this module's.

Most of what follows was first written when the rules guarded a per-segment stored procedure; it holds for
`build.py` unchanged, and the rule names, the allow-lists and every name the gate refuses are what the agent-file
test reads from this module.

Conservative and structural (Task 3 fix round 1, coordinator ruling -- the rules as first written
were evadable by ordinary Python, which the task-3 review's evasion probes demonstrated; every one
of those probes is reproduced as a test in `tests/test_snowpark_rules.py`):

* `session` may appear ONLY as the receiver of `session.table(...)` or
  `session.create_dataframe(...)`, written directly in the one top-level `main` -- not aliased
  (`s = session`), not passed as a call argument, not read through any other attribute
  (`session.sql`, `session.call`, `getattr(session, ...)`, ...), and not taken as a parameter or
  referenced (free variable) by any other function, lambda, or nested/class-level `def main`
  anywhere in the module. Exactly one `def main` may exist in the whole module (found via
  `ast.walk`, not just the module body), and it must be that one top-level definition.
* `.table(...)`, `.save_as_table(...)` and its real camelCase alias `.saveAsTable(...)` --
  whatever they are chained into afterward, `.merge(...)` included -- take exactly one positional
  argument, a string literal or an f-string over `src` / `tgt`; no keyword arguments
  (`name=...`/`table_name=...` are refused, not silently unchecked).

Final fix wave (whole-branch review I1/I2/I4, coordinator ruling): the rules above still keyed on
two method names and on the literal receiver name `session`, so three ordinary-Python moves walked
straight past them. All three are closed here, in the same conservative-and-structural register:

* A build.py has exactly ONE sink. Every other `DataFrameWriter` sink (`insert_into`,
  `copy_into_location`, `csv`, `json`, `parquet`, `orc`, `save`, and the camelCase aliases) writes
  somewhere the objective does not declare, so the NAME is refused wherever it appears -- as an
  `ast.Attribute`'s `attr` or as a bare `ast.Name` -- whatever the receiver is called. Round 2
  (scoped re-review, R1) adds the three routes that are not `DataFrameWriter` at all:
  `create_or_replace_view` / `_temp_view` / `_dynamic_table` (which SUCCEED in the Local Testing
  Framework, so the undeclared object is really created and the build still PASSes),
  `write_pandas` / `copy_into_table` / `cache_result`, and the `pandas` writers a `to_pandas()`
  frame carries (`to_csv`, `to_parquet`, `to_sql`, ... -- `PANDAS_WRITERS`). `to_pandas` itself
  stays legal: it is how row-sequential logic is expressed at all.
* A write method that is REFERENCED rather than called (`sink = w.save_as_table; sink("ANY.TABLE")`)
  is an `ast.Attribute` that is never a call's `func`, so no argument is ever checked. Refused.
* The `{src}.NAME` / `{tgt}.NAME` forms were checked by SHAPE only, so any identifier at all
  passed. `NAME` must now be a logical the objective declares -- `inputs[].logical` for the source
  form, `outputs[].logical` for the target form. There is no fallback: a write to a logical the
  objective never declared is exactly what must be refused.
* `Session` is refused outright (bare name, attribute, or `from ... import` alias): a build.py
  is HANDED a session, it never builds or fetches one, and `Session.builder.getOrCreate()` returns
  the very session `main` was given under a name no receiver-based rule was watching. Every session
  method (`sql`, `call`, `add_packages`, `udf`, `file`, `use_role`, `close`, ...) is likewise
  refused as an attribute of ANY receiver -- and so, from round 2, is the attribute `session`
  itself: `DataFrame.session` is the live session, so `df.session.write_pandas(...)` reached it
  without ever writing the bare name.
* A fixed list of DataFrame-API raw-SQL escape hatches (`sql_expr`, `call_function`, ...) is
  refused wherever it appears: as a bare name, as an attribute (`F.sql_expr`), or in a
  `from ... import ...` -- even one that is never called.

Task 3 fix round 2 (coordinator ruling): a fixed list of Name/Attribute checks cannot see a name
reached through `__dict__`, `__getattribute__`, or the classic `().__class__.__base__.
__subclasses__()` object-graph walk -- none of those are the forbidden name itself, `__dict__` and
friends are. So any dunder access anywhere in the module (an `ast.Attribute` whose `attr` starts
with `__`, or an `ast.Name` whose `id` does, except `__import__`, which is already forbidden by
name and keeps its own message) is refused under the existing `rule:no_io` -- the spec fixes the
rule-name list, so this is not a new rule. `startswith("__")` is the simulator's own test
(`alteryx_sim._check_python_tool_script`), so the "mirrors it" claim above is exact: a
name-mangled `__private` is refused here too (final fix wave M4).
