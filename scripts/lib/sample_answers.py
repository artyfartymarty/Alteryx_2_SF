"""Shared lookup from a sample workflow's recorded answers (`samples/<wf>/sample.json["answers"]`)
onto one of its touchpoints.

Two callers share this, and neither forks it: `tests/helpers.py::prepare_intake_ready` drives
`intake_prompt.apply_answers` directly to build a fully-answered workflow with no human at a prompt,
and `scripts/dev/answer_samples.py` feeds the same answers
through the ordinary `manifest.answers` / `intake_prompt.py --no-interactive` resume path for the
orchestrator's offline end-to-end runs (plan Task 15 Step 5). A sample workflow's set of recorded
answers means the same thing wherever it is consumed.
