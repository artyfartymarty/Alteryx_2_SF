"""A runtime sandbox for agent-written Snowpark code (live hardening L4 fix round 2, X1).

The Snowpark Local Testing Framework runs a workflow's `build.py` as ordinary in-process Python, so
the static Snowpark rules (`lib.snowpark_rules`) are the only thing between the agent's code and the
host -- and they allow `pandas`/`numpy` wholesale, which expose object-loading and file-reading entry
points a gate-passing module can still call. This module is the runtime boundary the SQL path got
under P (DuckDB's locked external access), for the Snowpark path:

* The agent's code runs in a **child process** (`run_module`, the parent-side entry, spawns
  `python scripts/lib/snowpark_sandbox.py <spec>`). The parent keeps full rights to write reports;
  the child's rights are taken away by a `sys.addaudithook` armed BEFORE `build.py` is imported.
  An audit hook cannot be removed and lives for the whole process, which is why a fresh child is
  spawned for every execution rather than arming the hook in the validator itself.
* The hook (`_arm`/`_hook`) is DEFAULT-DENY (fix round 5): a deny-list loses to the next unlisted
  event -- the third escape used `pd.eval(..., engine="python")` to reach `_winapi.CreateFile`/
  `WriteFile`/`CreateProcess`, native calls that fired none of the `os.*`/`subprocess.*` events the
  deny-list watched -- so the hook now refuses EVERY event that is not on the recorded benign
  allow-list (`sandbox_events.json`, re-recorded by `scripts/dev/record_sandbox_events.py` from the
  canned build.py and every cookbook Snowpark example run in the sandbox), and refuses whole native families
  (`_winapi.*`, `winreg.*`, `ctypes.*`, `socket.*`, `subprocess.*`, `msvcrt.*`, `sqlite3.*`, `_wmi.*`,
  `urllib.*`) outright. It raises `SandboxViolation` -- and records it, so a module that swallows the
  exception is still failed -- with these argument checks kept for the events that carry a path or a
  name: any `open` for writing outside the per-run temp directory; any `open` for reading outside the
  temp directory and the interpreter's own installation (stdlib + site-packages, so pandas/Snowpark
  load their own modules; once armed NO workflow file is a read root, so the expected outputs in
  `golden/outputs/` are never readable, fix round 3); `os.listdir`/`scandir`/`stat`/`walk`/`glob`
  outside those read roots; `os.remove`/`rename`/`mkdir`/... outside the temp directory; `import` of
  `ctypes`/`socket`/`subprocess`/`multiprocessing`/`pickle`/`shelve`/`marshal`/`sqlite3`/`shutil`/
  `glob` after arming (the harness imports what it needs first); and `pickle.find_class` (always) and
  `marshal.loads`/`compile` (except from the import machinery). `exec` is a recorded benign event (the
  Snowpark Local Testing Framework `exec`s generated code from its own frames), safe to allow because
  the static gate leaves agent code no way to invoke `exec`/`eval`/`compile` at all.
* The child runs (fix round 3) under a wall-clock **timeout** (`SANDBOX_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`, overridable
  by env or CLI; its process tree is killed on expiry), in a **minimal environment** built by
  `_child_env` (only `PATH`, the temp variables and the OS's own system variables -- never
  `SNOWFLAKE_*`, tokens or the real user profile), and it **signs its result** with a per-run nonce:
  the nonce comes over stdin (fix round 4, E2, never an environment variable), is read and stdin
  closed before agent code runs, and lives only in a signing closure's cell -- not a module global or
  any live frame's local, so a frame walk cannot reach it. The parent rejects any result not signed
  with the nonce (`unauthenticated`), so neither a forged `result.json` nor a rewritten output file
  can fake a PASS. A memory cap is applied on POSIX (`RLIMIT_AS`); Windows has no cheap per-process
  cap, so the timeout bounds a runaway allocation there.

A refused event, a timeout, a raise from `main()`, or a read-back failure is reported to the parent
through the signed result file, never a traceback: the parent turns it into that build's FAIL
naming the reason (`validation.build_fail_report`). This is **defence in depth, not a security boundary**: the
sandbox was attacked three times (fix rounds 2-5 -- both gates are now allow-lists: the static gate
`lib.snowpark_rules` keeps `sys`, `pd.eval` and every off-list method out of reach, and this hook is
default-deny), but agent code still shares the harness's Python process, and the hook depends on the
static gate.
Production runs the pipeline in the program spec's container, or validates Snowpark procedures only on
Snowflake (`docs/production-backlog.md`, "Isolate agent-code execution").
