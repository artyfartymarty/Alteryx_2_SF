"""Golden CSV → sandbox tables, and the schemas a build file is run against (contracts C2/C3; objective-first
design §4.8).

    python scripts/load_golden.py <wf_id> <golden_set> [--root .] [--db PATH]

A golden set is loaded the way a real run would see it:

* each mapped source's `golden/inputs/<set>/<tool_id>.csv` becomes `MIG_GOLDEN.<WF>_<SET>_IN_<id>`;
* a view schema `MIGDB.MIG_GOLDEN_<WF>_<SET>` exposes each source under its *logical* name, which
  is the only name the procedure knows — production swaps this schema for the one
  `gen_source_views.py` writes, and the procedure body does not change;
* `golden/targets_before/<set>/<LOGICAL>.csv` becomes `MIGDB.MIG_WORK.<LOGICAL>`, the starting
  state an update/insert or append output merges into. Outputs that overwrite have no such file.

A source with no `logical` name is an error: the pipeline never guesses a table name.

Golden data is the inputs and the final outputs only (design D5): the inputs and `targets_before` are loaded
here, the outputs are what `validate_build.py` compares against, and there is no golden data for any stream
in between, so nothing here loads one. A build file reads `{{src}}.<LOGICAL>` and writes
`{{tgt}}.<LOGICAL>`; `build_schemas` names the two schemas it is rendered with.
