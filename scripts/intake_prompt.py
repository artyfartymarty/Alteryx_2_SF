"""Ask the workflow owner which Snowflake table each touchpoint `intake_touchpoints.py` found
corresponds to (program spec §5) -- this is the project owner's one explicit requirement beyond
the written spec: the pipeline asks a human to name the Snowflake table for every `.yxdb` file (and
every other input and output), and it never invents one. An unresolved touchpoint stays unresolved.

    python scripts/intake_prompt.py <wf_id> [--no-interactive] [--interactive] [--user NAME] [--root .]

Interactive prompting is the default only when stdin is a TTY (`sys.stdin.isatty()`); `--no-interactive`
forces it off (resume from `intake/open_questions.md` and `manifest.answers` instead) and
`--interactive` forces it on (for an orchestrator that inherits a real terminal). Exit codes: `0`
for `READY`; `1` for `WAITING_FOR_ANSWERS`, `BLOCKED` or `NEEDS_HUMAN` (all three are legitimate
outcomes, not errors); `2` for a usage error -- an unknown workflow, a workflow that hasn't been
through `intake_touchpoints.py` yet, or anything unexpected.

Everything a human types here is DATA, never an instruction and never a path: a Snowflake name is
only ever accepted when it matches `FQN_RE`, and a yxdb path typed in answer to "Local copy of …"
or "Path of the yxdb" is used only to call `lib.yxdb.read_header` on it (never written to); a path
that doesn't exist or isn't a readable yxdb is reported and skipped, never fatal.

      (source or output) share one -- they would collide in the sandbox view schema;

      entirely for a `note: "user-declared"` entry, which has no touchpoint and legitimately
      carries `tool_ids: []`);

    `promote_to_global` is true, promotes every newly mapped source/output to
    `mappings/global.yaml` (`load_path: already_there`) unless the key is already there with a
    *different* table, in which case nothing is overwritten and the key is recorded in the
    returned `conflicts` list (status `NEEDS_HUMAN`). Returns `{"status", "mappings", "conflicts",
    "missing", "problems", "confirmed_constants", "answers_by_qid"}` -- `missing`/`problems` are
    `_missing_blocking_entries`/`_mapping_problems`'s own findings (fix round 2), the same two
    checks `run`'s guard re-runs independently against the file it actually wrote: a touchpoint
    with no entry at all is normal mid-session (`missing`, `WAITING_FOR_ANSWERS`); an entry that
    exists but fails validation is a genuine violation (`problems`, `NEEDS_HUMAN`).

    `promote_to_global=False` (coordinator ruling F1c) never turns off the CONSISTENCY check --
    an answer that disagrees with what `mappings/global.yaml` already has for that key is still a
    `conflicts` entry, still `NEEDS_HUMAN`, whether or not this call is allowed to promote -- it
    only skips writing a *new* key into `global_map`. The caller (`run`) decides this from how the
    identity behind `user` was obtained: an interactive session or an explicitly-given `--user`
    promotes; the default non-interactive `automation` identity does not (program-wide answers are
    intended, reviewed program state, not something a resume with nobody at a keyboard should
    silently add to).

    `intake/mappings.yaml` is CUMULATIVE and SELF-SUFFICIENT (coordinator ruling 1, fix round 1):
    this starts from whatever the file already has -- not a blank slate -- and layers this call's
    answers on top; a later answer for a key replaces the earlier entry, but nothing already
    recorded is ever dropped just because this call didn't happen to re-answer it. On top of that,
    every input/output touchpoint that is `resolved` (from `mappings/global.yaml`, via
    `intake_touchpoints.py`'s own resolution) and not already covered by an entry gets one
    backfilled here too, `confirmed_by` taken from the *global* entry's own `confirmed_by` plus
    `from: "global"` -- so a workflow whose sources were all confirmed in earlier sessions, and
    then simply resolved from the program-wide file on a later `intake_touchpoints.py` run, still
    ends up with a fully self-sufficient `intake/mappings.yaml`: nothing here ever needs a reader
    to fall back to `mappings/global.yaml` (nothing outside this module does; `load_golden.py`
    reads only the workflow's own file).
