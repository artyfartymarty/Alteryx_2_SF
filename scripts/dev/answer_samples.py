"""Feed each sample workflow's recorded answers into `manifest.json["answers"]`, so a
`workflows/<wf_id>/` parked at `WAITING_FOR_ANSWERS` by a non-interactive `intake_prompt.py` run
can be resumed by a second one with nobody at a keyboard (plan Task 15 Step 5 -- the orchestrator's
offline end-to-end run).

    python scripts/dev/answer_samples.py [--only wf_id] [--samples samples] [--root .]

For every `workflows/<wf_id>/` that has already been through `scripts/intake_touchpoints.py` (an
`intake/touchpoints.json` on disk) and whose `samples/<wf_id>/sample.json` records `"answers"`,
this looks up each blocking, unresolved touchpoint's answer with `lib.sample_answers.answer_for`
-- the same key-then-tool-id lookup `tests/helpers.py::prepare_intake_ready` uses to build its own
pytest fixtures, not forked here -- and writes it into `manifest.json["answers"]`.
`intake_prompt.py --no-interactive` merges that dict with whatever is already checked off in
`intake/open_questions.md` on its very next run (`intake_prompt._merged_answers`). Write mode and
merge keys are never written here: `intake_prompt.py` always derives those from the touchpoint's
own recorded Alteryx write mode (`intake_prompt._default_write_mode`) -- the same "proposal
default" a human accepting Enter would get, whether or not this script ever ran.

This never invents an answer: a blocking touchpoint `sample.json["answers"]` has nothing for stays
out of `manifest.json["answers"]` entirely and is reported by its question id, same as if a human
had left it blank. A workflow that has not been through `intake_touchpoints.py` yet is a usage
error when named explicitly with `--only`; found while scanning every `workflows/*` directory (no
`--only` given), it simply is not this script's business yet and is skipped without affecting the
exit code -- same for a workflow with no matching `samples/<wf_id>/sample.json`, or one whose
sample records no `"answers"` at all.

Nothing here has run against a real Snowflake account or Alteryx: `sample.json["answers"]` is a
fixture's own hand-recorded stand-in for what a human would have typed at the real prompt.

A `sample.json["answers"]` key that matches no touchpoint at all (a stale or mistyped key --
fix round 1) is never silently dropped: it is named on stderr as a WARNING, once per processed
workflow, and never affects the exit code -- it means the fixture and the workflow have drifted,
which is worth a human's attention but is not itself a reason to fail the run.

Exit codes follow the plan's Global Constraints: 0 when every blocking touchpoint of every
processed workflow now has an answer on file (already resolved, already answered earlier, or
newly written here); 1 when at least one is left with nothing to answer it (named on stderr); 2
for a usage error (an unknown `--only` workflow, a missing `samples/` directory, a `sample.json`
that fails to parse) or anything unexpected.
