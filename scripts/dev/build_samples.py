"""Seed a sample workflow into a working `workflows/<wf_id>/` tree and build its simulated golden
sets, chaining the parser and the Alteryx simulator (program spec §7.5/§8).

    python scripts/dev/build_samples.py seed  [--only wf_0001] [--samples samples] [--root .]
    python scripts/dev/build_samples.py build [--only wf_0001] [--samples samples] [--root .]

`seed` copies one `samples/<wf_id>/` fixture's source and golden inputs into `workflows/<wf_id>/`
and writes its `manifest.json`. `build` does that, then runs `parse.run` and `dev.alteryx_sim.run` over
the result, so every end-to-end test and the intake tests have something to start from. A workflow is one
build file (objective-first design D1), and its golden data is the inputs and the final outputs only (D5).
Every test-only fixture under `samples/` this script touches is a hand written stand-in (dag-contract.md);
nothing here has run against real Alteryx or Snowflake.

`--only` builds a single sample; without it, every `samples/wf_*` directory is processed (`_tools`
is a helper directory, not a workflow, and is skipped). Exit codes follow the plan's Global
Constraints: 0 on success (a workflow whose parse trips the invariants check, like `wf_0005`, is
the simulator's designed refusal path, not a failure, and still counts as success), 1 when a
sample cannot be built for a reason this script checks for (a missing sample fixture, a source
that fails to parse), and 2 for a usage error (an unknown
`--only` id, a missing `samples/` directory, or anything unexpected) with nothing created.

    What this guarantees, exactly, about the path it deletes -- the *lexical* path, spelled out
    from the workflow folder down and never passed through `.resolve()`. Each check raises
    `BuildError` on its own, and all of them run before anything is deleted:
      1. `parts` is non-empty, so this never deletes a whole workflow folder;
      2. no part contains a `.` or `..` component (checked here, splitting on both separators,
         rather than trusting `lib.paths._validate_part` to have done it);
      3. the lexical path is one of `_owned_dirs` or lies lexically inside one of them, compared
         case-insensitively (`os.path.normcase`) -- never `intake/` or anything else;
      4. no component of it, from `repo.wf(wf_id)` down to the target itself, is a symlink, a
         junction or any other reparse point (`_refuse_links_on_path`);
      5. it still resolves to somewhere strictly inside the workflow folder.
    Only then is the LEXICAL path handed to `shutil.rmtree`, so rmtree's own refusal to act on a
    link is one more line of defence rather than something a pre-resolved path walks straight past
    (which is exactly what round 3 did: `rmtree` got the dereferenced path of `intake/`).

    What it does NOT claim: this is not a privilege boundary. Planting a link inside
    `workflows/<wf_id>/` already needs write access to the very tree this script rewrites, so the
    checks are robustness against a malformed or mis-provisioned tree (a junction left by a
    half-migrated checkout, a hand-made shortcut to another drive), not protection from someone
    who has that access. None of it is atomic: a link planted between check 4 and the `rmtree`
    would not be seen by the walk, only by `rmtree` itself.
