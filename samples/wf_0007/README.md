# wf_0007 — regional targets and attainment

`source/regional_targets.yxmd`, E1 engine, 9 nodes: 7 tools plus Tool Container 10 "Pair plan
targets with actuals" (holding 1–3) and Tool Container 11 "Current-year attainment" (holding 4–7).
Workflow constant `User.CurrentYear` = `2026` (`IsNumeric False`).

**This file was written by hand to `docs/reference/dag-contract.md`. It has never been produced
or opened by Alteryx.** The ODBC string on tool 7 carries deliberately fake placeholders
(`UID=svc_alx;PWD=__EncPwd2__`) so the parser's scrubber has something to remove.

## Why this sample exists

It is the sample with two outputs written in two modes from one Summarize: `REGION_ATTAINMENT` is overwritten and
`ATTAINMENT_HISTORY` is a merge on two keys into a table that keeps prior state (`targets_before`). Both Output tools
read the same stream, so the build computes the summary once and writes it twice. There is no PreSQL or PostSQL.

## The tool chain

| Tool | Behaviour under test |
|------|----------------------|
| 1 input | plan targets, `REGION`, `PERIOD`, `TARGET` |
| 2 input | booked actuals, one row per sales line, `REGION`, `PERIOD`, `ACTUAL` |
| 3 join | inner join on **two** keys (`REGION`, `PERIOD`); a NULL key matches nothing; a key with several actual lines fans the target out; `Right_REGION`, `Right_PERIOD` deselected |
| 4 filter | `Left([PERIOD], 4) = [User.CurrentYear]` — a text constant, compared as text |
| 5 summarize | group by `REGION`, `PERIOD`; `Sum` of both amounts (FixedDecimal stays FixedDecimal), `Count` → `LINES` (rows) |
| 6 output | `region_attainment.yxdb`, `Overwrite` → `CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE` |
| 7 output | ODBC `dbo.ATTAINMENT_HISTORY`, `Update; Insert if new` on `REGION, PERIOD` → a `MERGE` on both keys, with prior state in `targets_before` |

## Shape

The workflow is one build file. The two Tool Containers ("Pair plan targets with actuals" and "Current-year
attainment") are layout; the Join stays with both of its inputs and the year filter sits beside the outputs, which is
where the first broken build needs it. Tool 5's one output feeds both Output tools.

## `normal`

`golden_inputs/normal/1.csv` (targets, 6 rows):

| Row | Why it is there |
|---|---|
| `EAST` `2026-01` `100.00` | joins **two** actual lines, so the fan-out sends it to the Summarize twice (`TARGET_TOTAL` 200.00, `LINES` 2) |
| `EAST` `2026-02` `120.00` | a second period of a region the history already holds — the row a merge keyed on `REGION` alone never inserts |
| `WEST` `2026-01` `80.00` | its only actual is NULL, so `ACTUAL_TOTAL` is NULL, not 0 |
| `WEST` `2025-12` `75.00` | prior year: joined, then dropped by the filter |
| `NORTH` `2026-01` `50.00` | no actual: the inner join drops it |
| NULL `2026-01` `10.00` | a NULL key matches nothing |

`golden_inputs/normal/2.csv` (actuals, 6 rows): `EAST 2026-01` twice (`90.00`, `15.00` — the
fan-out), `EAST 2026-02`, `WEST 2026-01` with a NULL `ACTUAL`, `WEST 2025-12`, and `SOUTH 2026-01`,
which has no target and is dropped by the join.

`golden_inputs/targets_before/normal/ATTAINMENT_HISTORY.csv` (3 rows, typed exactly like tool 5's
output):

| Row | Why it is there |
|---|---|
| `EAST` / `2026-01` | a key the run also produces → **updated** |
| `WEST` / `2025-12` | prior year, filtered out of the run → **kept** untouched; a merge keyed on `REGION` alone overwrites it with `WEST 2026-01` |
| `NORTH` / `2025-11` | a key the run never produces → **kept** |

## `period_end`

The year boundary: `EAST` and `WEST` each have a `2025-12` and a `2026-01` target with one actual
line apiece, so only the two January keys survive the filter. `targets_before` holds `WEST 2026-01`
(updated) and `EAST 2025-12` (kept as it was: the run filters December out, so the history row is
never touched, although the run's own December figures differ from it).

## `empty`

Header rows only, for both inputs and for `targets_before`, so an empty run leaves both targets
empty.

## `edge`

| Row | Why it is there |
|---|---|
| `DUP` `2026-03` `10.00`, twice | a byte-identical duplicate target: both copies join the one actual line, so `TARGET_TOTAL` is 20.00 and `LINES` 2 |
| `NORDÖST` `2026-02` | non-ASCII letters in a join and group key |
| `NEG` `2026-04` | a negative `ACTUAL` (`-3.25`) |
| `BAD` `2026-1` | a malformed `PERIOD` whose first four characters are `2026`, so the filter keeps it; the golden data records it as a group of its own |

`targets_before/edge` holds `DUP 2026-03` (updated) and `OLD 2025-06` (kept).

## Broken builds

`broken/01_filter_not_translated.sql` drops the year filter and `broken/02_merge_key_narrowed.sql` narrows the merge
key to `REGION`; each is the canned build with that one mistake, and `broken/broken.json` records the diff class
`validate_build.py` reports for it on the `normal` set.

## Hand migration

`canned/` holds the artifacts the orchestrator's mock runner replays instead of calling an agent:
`intake/plan.md`, `objective.json` and `objective.md` (the analyzer's), the workflow's one build file
(`build.sql`), `translation_notes.md`, `review.json` (a clean PASS) and `docs/migration.md`. `broken/`
holds whole-file copies of the build, each with one deliberate translator mistake, and `broken/broken.json`
records which diff class `scripts/compare.py` reports for each of them. `tests/test_validate_build.py`
runs the canned build and every broken one against the golden sets; `tests/test_canned_builds.py`,
`tests/test_canned_objectives.py` and `tests/test_canned_artifacts.py` check their shape. **Nothing here has
run on Snowflake or on Alteryx.**
